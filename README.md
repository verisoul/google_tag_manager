# Verisoul Google Tag Manager

Verisoul will listen to form submissions and try to automatically parse the email field from the form submission. The email will be sent to Verisoul's API. The data about the user submitting the form will be available in the Verisoul dashboard and API.

You must currently have access to the Verisoul dashboard ( https://dashboard.verisoul.ai ). In the API Keys section of the dashboard you will find the Project ID.

Accounts will populate in the dashboard if the email and account are being collected correctly. Note that accounts can take up to 5 minutes to show up in the dashboard. Data is available in real time via the API.
